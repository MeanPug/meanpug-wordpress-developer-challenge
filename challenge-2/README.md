## Getting Started
We've tried to make it _super easy_ to get up and running on this [challenge](https://github.com/MeanPug/meanpug-wordpress-developer-challenge). Simply `cd` to the directory, and run the `docker compose up -d` to bring up a fully functional Wordpress environment at `localhost:8000`, complete with a Gulp build system and Tailwind + PostCSS CSS integration.

## The Project
Welcome to the Law Firm of Pug and Puggle, ESQ. In this challenge, you'll be implementing the backend for a law firm's website.
What are some things you'll want to include on a firm's site? Looking at the websites of [Morgan and Morgan](https://www.forthepeople.com/) and [Milberg](https://www.milberg.com) would be a great starting point!
